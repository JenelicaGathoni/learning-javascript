//The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets
//When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property.
//When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name.
//the dot notation works only with names that look like valid binding
//namesâ€”starting with a letter or underscore, and containing only letters, numbers, and underscores.
//If you want to access a property named 2 or John Doe, you must use square brackets: value[2] or value["John Doe"].

//Using the to uppercase method
let food = "pilau";
console.log(food.toUpperCase());
//Using the to Lowercase method
