Correlation is a measure of dependence between statistical variables.
Correlation between variables is usually expressed as a value that ranges from -1 to 1. 
Zero correlation means the variables are not related.
A correlation of 1 indicates that the two are perfectly related—if you know one, you also know the other.
Negative 1 also means that the variables are perfectly related but are opposites—when one is true, the other is false.
